<!-- One of the questions this week asks you to fill in a table; that table is copied here from the course page's markdown
     (https://edit.htgaa.org/2026a-course-pages/webpages.git/src/branch/main/content/weeks/week-01/_index.md?display=source)
     just as a convenience -- you DON'T have to use this to complete your homework!  Any form, format or content which is
     responsive to the question is acceptable (the more creative the better!).

     If you want to use this form, you can fill in the table by putting your scoring for each action between the |  | markers
     for each column; DO NOT enter any newlines between the |  | markers, that starts a new table row right there!
