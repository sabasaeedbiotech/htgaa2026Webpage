<!-- The 'children' call below this 'homework' heading automatically lists all the homework you've completed.
     You don't need to change it (and might want to leave it as-is for a couple weeks till you can see what it does with multiple weeks).
     Then if you like you can try customizing its formatting, e.g. try switching to type="card" and/or description="false" -->
